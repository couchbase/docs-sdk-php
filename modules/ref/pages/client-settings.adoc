TIP: The backend implementation of client settings changed substantially in 4.0.
Full details can be found in https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client-4.0.0/classes/Couchbase-ClusterOptions.html[the API Reference].

== Configuration Profiles

Configuration Profiles provide predefined client settings that allow you to quickly configure an environment for common use-cases.
When using a configuration profile, the current client settings are overridden with the values provided in the profile.
Any property that is not specified in the profile is left unchanged.

CAUTION: The Configuration Profiles feature is currently a xref:php-sdk:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[Volatile API] and may be subject to change.

=== WAN Development

*Cluster Option:* `applyProfile("wan_development")`

A `wan_development` configuration profile can be used to modify client settings for development or high-latency environments.
This profile changes the default timeouts.

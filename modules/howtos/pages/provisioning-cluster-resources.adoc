Common use cases are outlined here, less common use cases are covered in the https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2?tab=doc[API docs].

include::7.1@sdk:shared:partial$flush-info-pars.adoc[tag=management-intro]

The PHP SDK also comes with some convenience functionality for common Couchbase management requests.
////
Management operations in the SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:

* BucketManager -- `Cluster.Buckets()`
* UserManager -- `Cluster.Users()` // see xref
* QueryIndexManager -- `Cluster.QueryIndexes()`
* AnalyticsIndexManager -- `Cluster.AnalyticsIndexes()`
* SearchIndexManager -- `Cluster.SearchIndexes()`
* CollectionManager -- `Bucket.Collections()`
* ViewIndexManager -- `Bucket.ViewIndexes()`.
////
NOTE: When using a Couchbase version earlier than 6.5, you must create a valid Bucket connection using `cluster.Bucket(name)` before you can use cluster level managers.


== Creating and Removing Buckets

The `ClusterManager` interface may be used to create and delete buckets from the Couchbase cluster.
It is instantiated through the `Cluster.Buckets()` method.

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-buckets.go[tag=creatingbucketmgr]
----
////

The `CreateBucketSettings` and `BucketSettings` structs are used for creating and updating buckets, `BucketSettings` is also used for exposing information about existing buckets.

include::7.1@sdk:shared:partial$flush-info-pars.adoc[tag=update-bucket-warning]

////
Here is the list of parameters available:

|====
| Name | Description | Can be updated
| `Name string` | The name of the bucket, required for creation. | false
| `FlushEnabled boolean` | Enables flushing to be performed on this bucket (see the <<go-flushing>> section below). | true
| `ReplicaIndexDisabled boolean` | Whether or not to replicate indexes. | false
| `RAMQuotaMB uint64` | How much memory should each node use for the bucket, required for creation. | true
| `NumReplicas uint32` | The number of replicas to use for the bucket. | true
| `BucketType BucketType` | The type of the bucket, required for creation. | false
| `EvictionPolicy EvictionPolicyType` | The type of the eviction to use for the bucket, defaults to `valueOnly`. | true (note: changing will cause the bucket to restart causing temporary inaccessibility)
| `MaxTTL time.Duration` | The default maximum time-to-live to apply to documents in the bucket. (note: This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.) | true
| `CompressionMode CompressionMode` | The compression mode to apply to documents in the bucket. (note: This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.) | true
| `ConflictResolutionType ConflictResolutionType` | The conflict resolution type to apply to conflicts on the bucket, defaults to `seqno` | false
|====

The following example creates a "hello" bucket:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-buckets.go[tag=createBucket]
----

We can now get this bucket and update it to enable Flush:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-buckets.go[tag=updateBucket]
----

Once you no longer need to use the bucket, you can remove it:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-buckets.go[tag=removeBucket]
----

[#go-flushing]
== Flushing Buckets

include::7.1@sdk:shared:partial$flush-info-pars.adoc[tag=flush-intro]

You can flush a bucket in the SDK by using the `flush()` method:
////
[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-buckets.go[tag=flushBucket]
----
////
The `flush()` operation may fail if the bucket does not have https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client/classes/Couchbase-BucketSettings.html[flush enabled], in that case it will return an `ErrBucketNotFlushable`.


== Collection Management

The CollectionManager interface may be used to create and delete scopes and collections from the Couchbase cluster.
It is instantiated through the `Bucket.collections()` method.
Refer to the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client/classes/Couchbase-CollectionManager.html[`CollectionManager` API documentation]
for further details.

[source,php]
----
include::example$collection-manager.php[tag=create-collection-manager,indent=0]
----

You can create a scope:

[source,php]
----
include::example$collection-manager.php[tag=create-scope,indent=0]
----

You can then create a collection within that scope:

[source,php]
----
include::example$collection-manager.php[tag=create-collection,indent=0]
----

Finally, you can drop unneeded collections and scopes:

[source,php]
----
include::example$collection-manager.php[tag=drop-collection,indent=0]

include::example$collection-manager.php[tag=drop-scope,indent=0]

----

Note that the most minimal permissions to create and drop a Scope or Collection is
xref:server:learn:security/roles.adoc#manage-scopes[Manage Scopes]
along with xref:server:learn:security/roles.adoc#data-reader[Data Reader].

You can create users with the appropriate RBAC programmatically:
[source,php]
----
include::example$collection-manager.php[tag=scopeAdmin, indent=0]

----

=== Listing the Scopes and Collections available

You can enumerate Scopes and Collections using
the `CollectionManager` and the properties of the
`ScopeSpec` and `CollectionSpec` objects retrieved.

== Index Management

In general,you will rarely need to work with Index Managers from the SDK.
For those occasions when you do, please see the relevant API docs:

* QueryIndexManager -- https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client/classes/Couchbase-QueryIndexManager.html[`QueryIndexManager`];
// * AnalyticsIndexManager -- https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2?tab=doc#Cluster.AnalyticsIndexes[``];
* SearchIndexManager -- https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client/classes/Couchbase-SearchIndexManager.html[`SearchIndexManager`];
* ViewIndexManager -- https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client/classes/Couchbase-ViewIndexManager.html[`ViewIndexManager`].

== View Management

include::7.1@sdk:shared:partial$flush-info-pars.adoc[tag=view-management]

In the SDK, design documents are represented by the `DesignDocument` and `View` structs.
All operations on design documents are performed on the `ViewIndexManager` instance:

////
[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-views.go[tag=viewmgr]
----

The following example upserts a design document with two views:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-views.go[tag=createView]
----

include::7.1@sdk:shared:partial$flush-info-pars.adoc[tag=one-view-update-warning]

Note the use of `DesignDocumentNamespaceDevelopment`, the other option is `DesignDocumentNamespaceProduction`.
This parameter specifies whether the design document should be created as development, or as production -- with the former running over only a small fraction of the documents.

Now that we've created a design document we can fetch it:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-views.go[tag=getView]
----

We've created the design document using `DesignDocumentNamespaceDevelopment` and now want to push it to production, we can do this with:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-views.go[tag=publishView]
----

To remove this design document:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/provisioning-resources-views.go[tag=removeView]
----

== Connecting to a Cluster

A connection to a Couchbase Server cluster is represented by a `cluster` object.
A `cluster` provides access to Buckets, Scopes, and Collections, as well as various Couchbase services and management interfaces.
The simplest way to create a `Cluster` is to call `new Cluster()` with a <<connection-strings, connection string>> and a `ClusterOptions` object containing your credentials:

[source,php]
----
include::example$connections.php[tag=rbac]
----
NOTE: If you are connecting to a version of Couchbase Server older than 6.5, it will be more efficient if the addresses are those of data (KV) nodes.
You will in any case, with 6.0 and earlier, need to open a `Bucket` instance before connecting to any other HTTP services (such as _Query_ or _Search_).

In a production environment, your connection string should include the addresses of multiple server nodes in case some are currently unavailable.
Multiple addresses may be specified in a connection string by delimiting them with commas:

[source,php]
----
include::example$managing-connections.php[tag=multiplenodes,indent=0]
----

TIP: You don't need to include the address of every node in the cluster.
The client fetches the full address list from the first node it is able to contact.

== Connection Strings

WARNING: The backend implementation of connection strings parameters changed substantially in 4.0 and is not currently fully documented.
This will be resolved in a future 4.x release.
See xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc#sdk4-specifics[more details on migrating to 4.0].

A Couchbase connection string is a comma-delimited list of IP addresses and/or hostnames, optionally followed by a list of parameters.

The parameter list is just like the query component of a URI; name-value pairs have an equals sign (`=`) separating the name and value, with an ampersand (`&`) between each pair.
Just as in a URI, the first parameter is prefixed by a question mark (`?`).

.Simple connection string with one seed node
----
127.0.0.1
----

.Connection string with two seed nodes
----
nodeA.example.com,nodeB.example.com
----

.Connection string with two parameters
----
127.0.0.1?io.networkResolution=external&timeout.kvTimeout=10s
----

// The full list of recognized parameters is documented in the client settings reference.

A connection string may optionally be prefixed by either `"couchbase://"` or, for TLS, `"couchbases://"`. 


== Connection Lifecycle

Most of the high-level classes in the PHP SDK are designed to be safe for concurrent use by multiple threads.

We recommend creating a single `Cluster` instance when your application starts up, and sharing this instance throughout your application.
If you know at startup time which buckets, scopes, and collections your application will use, we recommend obtaining them from the `Cluster` at startup time and sharing those instances throughout your application as well.


== Alternate Addresses and Custom Ports

If your Couchbase Server cluster is running in a containerized, port mapped, or otherwise NAT'd environment like Docker or Kubernetes, a client running outside that environment may need additional information in order to connect the cluster.
Both the client and server require special configuration in this case.

On the server side, each server node must be configured to advertise its external address as well as any custom port mapping.
This is done with the `setting-alternate-address` xref:7.1@server:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-alternate-address.adoc[CLI command] introduced in Couchbase Server 6.5.
A node configured in this way will advertise two addresses: one for connecting from the same network, and another for connecting from an external network.

On the client side, the externally visible ports must be used when connecting.
If the external ports are not the default, you can specify custom ports instead of a connection string.

[source,php]
----
include::example$managing-connections.php[tag=customPorts,indent=0]
----

TIP: In a deployment that uses multi-dimensional scaling, a custom KV port is only applicable for nodes running the KV service.
A custom manager port may be specified regardless of which services are running on the node.

In many cases the client is able to automatically select the correct set of addresses to use when connecting to a cluster that advertises multiple addresses.
If the detection heuristic fails in your environment, you can override it by setting the `io.networkResolution` client setting to `default` if the client and server are on the same network, or `external` if they're on different networks.

NOTE: Any TLS certificates must be set up at the point where the connections are being made.
// todo what does that mean in practice? Also, should this be in the TLS docs section instead?


[#ssl]
== Secure Connections
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition supports full encryption of client-side traffic using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
That includes key-value type operations, queries, and configuration communication.
Make sure you have the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server before proceeding with configuring encryption on the client side.

To configure encryption for the PHP SDK:

. Get the CA certificate from the cluster and save it in a text file.
. Enable encryption on the client side and point it to the file containing the certificate.

It is important to make sure you are transferring the certificate in an encrypted manner from the server to the client side, 
so either copy it through SSH or through a similar secure mechanism.

If you are running on `localhost` and just want to enable TLS for a development machine, just copying and pasting it suffices
-- _so long as you use `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost` in the connection string_.
This is because the certificate will not match the name _localhost_.
Setting `TLSSkipVerify` is a workaround if you need to use `couchbases://localhost`.

Navigate in the admin UI to menu:Settings[Cluster] and copy the input box of the TLS certificate into a file on your machine (which we will refer to as `cluster.crt`).  
It looks similar to this:

----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIICmDCCAYKgAwIBAgIIE4FSjsc3nyIwCwYJKoZIhvcNAQEFMAwxCjAIBgNVBAMT

F4+FjEqAEIr1mQepDaNM0gEfVcgd2SzGhC3yhYFBAH//8W4DUot5ciEhoBs=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

The next step is to enable encryption by connecting to a cluster with the 'couchbases://' protocol in the connection string 
and pass it the path to the certificate file via '?trust_certificate=...' in the connection string itself.

[source,php]
----
include::example$managing-connections.php[tag=tls,indent=0]
----

Then use this custom `Cluster` when opening the connection to the cluster.

If you want to verify it's actually working, you can use a tool like `tcpdump`.
For example, an unencrypted upsert request looks like this (using `sudo tcpdump -i lo0 -A -s 0 port 11210`):

----
E..e..@.@.............+......q{...#..Y.....
.E...Ey........9........................id{"key":"value"}
----

After enabling encryption, you cannot inspect the traffic in cleartext (same upsert request, but watched on port 11207 which is the default encrypted port):

----
E.....@.@.............+....Z.'yZ..#........
..... ...xuG.O=.#.........?.Q)8..D...S.W.4.-#....@7...^.Gk.4.t..C+......6..)}......N..m..o.3...d.,.	...W.....U..

// DNS-SRV
include::{version-common}@sdk:shared:partial$dnssrv-pars.adoc[tag=dnssrv]

DNS SRV bootstrapping is available in the PHP SDK from version 3.0.
In order to make the SDK actually use the SRV records, you need to enable DNS SRV on the environment and pass in the host name from your records (here `example.com`):

[source,php]
----
include::example$managing-connections.php[tag=dnssrv,indent=0]
----

If the DNS SRV records could not be loaded properly you'll get the message logged and the given host name will be used as an A record lookup.

----
[2020-09-07 14:30:26.358] [186383,186390] [warning] 47ms, DNS SRV query returned 0 records for "localhost", assuming that cluster is listening this address
----

Also, if you pass in more than one node, DNS SRV bootstrap will not be initiated:


// WaitUntilReady section to be added once it is in the SDK - PCBC-695 


// Cloud connections

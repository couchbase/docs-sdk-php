== User-Management APIs

Users who have been assigned the *Admin* role for the cluster are able to create, edit, and remove users.
The PHP SDK provides APIs to support these activities.
A high-level summary of the APIs can be found in xref:concept-docs:sdk-user-management-overview.adoc[User-Management],
and details of all options in the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client/classes/Couchbase-Management-UserManager.html[UserManager API docs].

== Using the UserManager API

The most common uses of the `UserManager` API are creating and listing users:

.Creating Users
[source,php]
----
include::howtos:example$provisioning-resources-users.php[tag=create-user,indent=0]
----

.Listing Users
[source,php]
----
include::howtos:example$provisioning-resources-users.php[tag=get-all-users,indent=0]
----

Using a user created in the SDK to access data:

[source,php]
----
include::howtos:example$provisioning-resources-users.php[tag=user-operations,indent=0]
----

The SDK also contains management APIs for dealing with xref:provisioning-cluster-resources.adoc[Cluster resources].

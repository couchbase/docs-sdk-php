== Documents

A _document_ refers to an entry in the database (other databases may refer to the same concept as a _row_).
A document has an ID (_primary key_ in other databases), which is unique to the document and by which it can be located.
The document also has a value which contains the actual application data.
See xref:concept-docs:documents.adoc[the concept guide to _Documents_] for a deeper dive into documents in the Couchbase Data Platform.
Or read on, for a hands-on introduction to working with documents from the PHP SDK.

== CRUD Operations

The core interface to Couchbase Server is simple KV operations on full documents.
Make sure you're familiar with the basics of authorization and connecting to a Cluster from the xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Start Using the SDK section].
We're going to expand on the short _Upsert_ example we used there, adding options as we move through the various CRUD operations.
Here is the _Insert_ operation at its simplest:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=insert]
----

Options may be added to operations:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=insertwithoptions]
----

Setting a Compare and Swap (CAS) value is a form of optimistic locking - dealt with in depth in the xref:concurrent-document-mutations.adoc[CAS page].
Here we just note that the CAS is a value representing the current state of an item; each time the item is modified, its CAS changes.
The CAS value is returned as part of a document’s metadata whenever a document is accessed.
Without explicitly setting it, a newly-created document would have a CAS value of _0_.

_Timeout_ is an optional parameter which is a integer value representing time duration in milliseconds.
Timeout sets the timeout value for the underlying network connection.
We will add to these options for the _Replace_ example:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=replacewithcas]
----

The example above also shows how to handle the case when optimistic falure will fail.

Expiration sets an explicit time to live (TTL) for a document.
We'll discuss modifying `expiry` in more details xref:#expiration-ttl[below].
For a discussion of item (Document) _vs_ Bucket expiration, see the
xref:7.0@server:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/expiration.adoc#expiration-bucket-versus-item[Expiration Overview page].

[source,php]

include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=upsertwithexpiry]
----

// TODO: old-style durability will come later

// Here, we have added _Durability_ options, namely `PersistTo` and `ReplicateTo`.

== Durability

In Couchbase Server releases before 6.5, Durability was set with these two options -- see the xref:2.6@php-sdk::durability.adoc[6.0 Durability documentation] -- covering  how many replicas the operation must be propagated to and how many persisted copies of the modified record must exist.
If a version of Couchbase Server lower than 6.5 is being used then the application can fall-back to xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#older-server-versions['client verified' durability]. 


If 6.5 or above is being used, you can take advantage of the xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#durable-writes[Durable Write] feature,
in which Couchbase Server will only return success to the SDK after the requested replication level has been achieved.
The three replication levels are:

 * `Majority` - The server will ensure that the change is available in memory on the majority of configured replicas.
 * `MajorityAndPersistToActive` - Majority level, plus persisted to disk on the active node.
 * `PersistToMajority` - Majority level, plus persisted to disk on the majority of configured replicas.

The options are in increasing levels of safety.
Note that nothing comes for free - for a given node, waiting for writes to storage is considerably slower than waiting for it to be available in-memory.
These trade offs, as well as which settings may be tuned, are discussed in the xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#durable-writes[durability page].

The following example demonstrates using the newer durability features available in Couchbase server 6.5 onwards.

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=upsertwithdurability]
----

To stress, durability is a useful feature but should not be the default for most applications, as there is a performance consideration,
and the default level of safety provided by Couchbase will be reasonable for the majority of situations.


[TIP]
.Sub-Document Operations
====
All of these operations involve fetching the complete document from the Cluster.
Where the number of operations or other circumstances make bandwidth a significant issue, the SDK can work on just a specific _path_ of the document with xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Document Operations].
====

== Retrieving full documents

Using the `Get()` method with the document key can be done in a similar fashion to the other operations:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=get]
----

Timeout can also be set - as in the earlier `Insert` example:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=getwithoptions]
----


== Removing

When removing a document, you will have the same concern for durability as with any additive modification to the Bucket:

Remove (with options)
[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=removewithoptions]
----
// TODO: old-style durability will come later


== Expiration / TTL

By default, Couchbase documents do not expire, but transient or temporary data may be needed for user sessions, caches, or other temporary documents.
Using `Touch()`, you can set expiration values on documents to handle transient data:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-expiry.php[tag=touch]
----

A network timeout can be set with the optional `TouchOptions()`, in the same fashion as earlier examples on this page:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-expiry.php[tag=touchwithoptions]
----

Another way to change expiration time is to use `getAndTouch()` method of the collection.

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-expiry.php[tag=getandtouch]
----

include::7.0@sdk:shared:partial$documents.adoc[tag=exp-note]


== Atomic Counters

The value of a document can be increased or decreased atomically using `Binary.Increment()` and `.Binary.Decrement()`.

.Increment
[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-counter.php[tag=increment]
----

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-counter.php[tag=incrementwithoptions]
----

.Decrement
[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-counter.php[tag=decrement]
----

.Decrement (with options)
[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-counter.php[tag=decrementwithoptions]
----

NOTE: Increment & Decrement are considered part of the ‘binary’ API and as such may still be subject to change

== Scoped KV Operations

It is possible to perform scoped key value operations on named xref:7.0@server:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[`Collections`] _with the beta version of the next Couchbase Server release, 7.0β_.
See the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client/classes/Couchbase-Collection.html[API docs] for more information.

CAUTION: This feature is marked xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[_Uncommitted_].
Expect a promotion to _Committed_ API in a future minor release.

Here is an example showing an upsert in the `users` collection, which lives in the `travel-sample.tenant_agent_00` keyspace:

[source,php]
----
include::example$kv-crud.php[tag=namedcollectionupsert]
----

== Additional Resources

Working on just a specific path within a JSON document will reduce network bandwidth requirements - see the xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Document] pages.

Another way of increasing network performance is to _pipeline_ operations with xref:concurrent-async-apis.adoc#batching-with-process-forks[Batching Operations].

As well as various xref:concept-docs:data-model.adoc[Formats] of JSON, Couchbase can work directly with xref:concept-docs:data-model:non-json.adoc[arbitary bytes, or binary format].

Our xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query Engine] enables retrieval of information using the SQL-like syntax of N1QL.

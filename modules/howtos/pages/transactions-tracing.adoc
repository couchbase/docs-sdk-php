//If configured, detailed telemetry on each transaction can be output that is compatible with various external systems including OpenTelemetry and its predecessor OpenTracing.
//This telemetry is particularly useful for monitoring performance.
//
//See the xref:howtos:observability-tracing.adoc[SDK Request Tracing documentation] for how to configure this.
//
//=== Parent Spans
//
//While the above is sufficient to use and output transaction spans, the application may wish to indicate that the transaction is part of a larger span -- for instance, a user request.
//It can do this by passing that as a parent span.
//
//If you have an existing OpenTelemetry span you can easily convert it to a Couchbase `RequestSpan` and pass it to the transactions library:

The Couchbase PHP SDK generally tracks PHP's own https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php[supported versions], and recommends the most recent "Active Support" version, except as specified in our documentation and especially the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[release notes].

As of January 2023, these versions are PHP 8.2 (Latest Active Support), 8.1 (Active Support), and 8.0 (Security Support)
 -- see the table below for <<php-version-compatibility,supported versions and dates>>.

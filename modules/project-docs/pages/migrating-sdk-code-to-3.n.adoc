= Migrating from SDK2 to SDK3 API
:description: The 3.0 API breaks the existing 2.0 APIs in order to provide a number of improvements. \
Collections and Scopes are introduced.

[abstract]
{description}
The Document class and structure has been completely removed from the API, and the returned value is now `Result`.
Retry behaviour is more proactive, and lazy bootstrapping moves all error handling to a single place.
Individual behaviour changes across services are explained here.

As an example here is a KeyValue document fetch:

[source,php]
----
$getResult = $collection->get("key", (new GetOptionsl())->timeout(3000000));
----

Compare this to a N1QL query:

[source,php]
----
$queryResult = $cluster->query("select 1=1", (new QueryOptions())->timeout(3000000));
----

// Outline below for individual SDKs -- please expand as appropriate, many topics can be covered lightly
//
// Please use before(2.n) / after (3.0) snippets in all cases where it is helpful
// (probably nearly everywhere, I'm afraid)


===  Installation and Configuration

As with 2.x release, the primary source of artifacts is xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[the release notes page], 
where we publish links to pre-built binaries, as well as to source tarballs.

SDK 3.x supports PHP interpreters from 7.3 upwards.

From 3.0 onwards, binaries are available for Windows with the OpenSSL dependency. 
Note, that OpenSSL DLLs are not distributed in the archive and must be installed separately (see the https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries[official OpenSSL page] for more details).

===  Connection Lifecycle

Bootstrapping the SDK is staged now, so the application has to create a Cluster object first, and then open the Bucket and
Collection if necessary.

As in SDK 2.x there is no explicit shutdown, and all underlying connections still kept in the cache, for reusing in
future requests. 
The connection idle time is controlled by the `couchbase.pool.max_idle_time_sec` PHP INI setting.

SDK 3.x allows the performance of Queries on the Cluster level, so it is not necessary to open a bucket anymore.

SDK 3.x does not allow the use of SASL PLAIN mechanism by default, instead it restricts to `SCRAM-SHA{1,256,512}`.

===  Exception Handling

SDK 3.x actively uses `Exceptions` to signal errors. 
Instead of using single `\Couchbase\Exception`, as in SDK 2.x, now we use a hierarchy of exceptions, which allows the handling of errors in a more reliable way:

[source,php]
----
try {
  $collection->get("foo");
} catch (\Couchbase\KeyNotFoundException $ex) {
  $collection->upsert("foo", ["bar" => 42]);
}
----

Instead of SDK 2.x's:

[source,php]
----
try {
  $bucket->get("foo");
} catch (\Couchbase\Exception $ex) {
  if ($ex->getCode() == COUCHBASE_KEYNOTFOUND) {
    $bucket->upsert("foo", ["bar" => 42]);
  }
}
----

=== Serialization and Transcoding

SDK 3.x still relies on native types and supports the `json_encode` API from the standard `json.so` module (therefore it still has to be loaded before `couchbase.so`). 
But the `igbinary.so` transcoder is no longer supported.

===  Migrating Services

==== Key Value

Most of the KV APIs have moved from bucket-level (in SDK 2.x) to collection-level (in SDK 3.x). 
For servers which don't support collections, the application should obtain the default collection using the `bucket\->defaultCollection()` function.

The following table describes the SDK 2 KV APIs and their equivalents in SDK 3:

.SDK 2.x KV API vs. SDK 3.x KV API
[options="header"]
|====
| SDK 2                          | SDK 3
|`Bucket\->upsert`                | `Collection\->upsert`
|`Bucket\->get`                   | `Collection\->get`
|-                               | `Collection\->exists`
|`Bucket\->getFromReplica`        | `Collection\->getAnyReplica` and `Collection.getAllReplicas`
|`Bucket\->getAndLock`            | `Collection\->getAndLock`
|`Bucket\->getAndTouch`           | `Collection\->getAndTouch`
|`Bucket\->insert`                | `Collection\->insert`
|`Bucket\->upsert`                | `Collection\->upsert`
|`Bucket\->replace`               | `Collection\->replace`
|`Bucket\->remove`                | `Collection\->remove`
|`Bucket\->unlock`                | `Collection\->unlock`
|`Bucket\->touch`                 | `Collection\->touch`
|`Bucket\->lookupIn`              | `Collection\->lookupIn`
|`Bucket\->mutateIn`              | `Collection\->mutateIn`
|`Bucket\->counter`               | `BinaryCollection\->increment` and `BinaryCollection\->decrement`
|`Bucket\->append`                | `BinaryCollection\->append`
|`Bucket\->prepend`               | `BinaryCollection\->prepend`
|====

The `BinaryCollection` mentioned above could be retrieved from the regular collection object using the `$collection\->binary()` method.

==== Query

Ib SDK 3.x, the API for Query was improved and now it is more consistent with other endpoints.

.SDK 2
[source,php]
----
$query = N1qlQuery::fromString('SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE city=$city AND type=$type');
$query->namedParams(['city' => "Los Angeles", 'type' => "airport"]);
$result = $bucket->query($query);
foreach ($result->rows as $row) {
  printf("%s\n", $row->airportname);
}
----

.SDK 3
[source,php]
----
$options = new QueryOptions();
$options->namedParameters(['city' => "Los Angeles", 'type' => "airport"]);
$result = $cluster->query('SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE city=$city AND type=$airport', $options);
foreach ($result->rows() as $row) {
  printf("%s\n", $row['airportname']);
}
----

==== Analytics

Analytics queries in SDK3 have their own API entry point.

.SDK 2
[source,php]
----
$query = AnalyticsQuery::fromString('SELECT * FROM dataset WHERE type = $type');
$query->namedParams(['type' => "airport"]);
$result = $bucket->query($query);
foreach ($result->rows as $row) {
  printf("%s\n", $row->airportname);
}
----

.SDK 3
[source,php]
----
$options = new AnalyticsQueryOptions();
$options->namedParameters(['type' => "airport"]);
$result = $cluster->analyticsQuery('SELECT * FROM dataset WHERE type = $type', $options);
foreach ($result->rows() as $row) {
  printf("%s\n", $row['airportname']);
}
----

==== Search

In SDK 3, query options and index name has been extracted from the query object.

.SDK 2
[source,php]
----
$queryPart = SearchQuery::matchPhrase("hop beer");
$query = new SearchQuery("beer-search", $queryPart);
$query->limit(3)->fields("name");

$result = $this->bucket->query($query);
foreach ($result->hits() as $hit) {
  printf("%s - %f\n", $hit->id, $hit->score);
}
----

.SDK 3
[source,php]
----
$query = new MatchPhraseSearchQuery("hop beer");
$options = new SearchOptions();
$options->limit(3);
$result = $cluster->search("beer-search", $query, $options);
foreach ($result->rows() as $row) {
  printf("%s - %f\n", $row['id'], $row['score']);
}
----

==== Views

The most noticeable change in the Views API for SDK 3.x is the change of names for consistency control settings.

.SDK 2
[source,php]
----
$query = ViewQuery::from('design_name', 'test');
$query->consistency(ViewQuery::UPDATE_BEFORE);
$res = $bucket->query($query);
foreach ($res->rows as $row) {
  printf("%s\n", $row->id);
}
----

.SDK 3
[source,php]
----
$options = new ViewOptions();
$options->scanConsistency(ViewScanConsistency::REQUEST_PLUS);
$res = $bucket->viewQuery('design_name', 'test', $options);
foreach ($res->rows() as $row) {
  printf("%s\n", $row->id());
}
----


== Management APIs

In SDK 2, the management APIs were centralized in the `ClusterManager` at the cluster level and the `BucketManager` at the bucket level.
Since SDK 3 provides more management APIs, they have been split up into their respective domains.
For example, when in SDK 2 you needed to remove a bucket you would call `ClusterManager.removeBucket` -- you will now find it under `BucketManager.dropBucket`.
And, creating a N1QL index now lives in the `QueryIndexManager`, which is accessible through the `Cluster`.

The following table provides a mapping from the SDK 2 management APIs to those of SDK 3:

.SDK 2.x vs SDK 3.x ClusterManager

|-                               | `BucketManager\->getBucket`
|`ClusterManager\->createBucket`  | `BucketManager\->createBucket`
|`ClusterManager\->removeBucket`  | `BucketManager\->removeBucket`
|`ClusterManager\->upsertUser`    | `UserManager\->upsertUser`
|`ClusterManager\->removeUser`    | `UserManager\->dropUser`

|`BucketManager\->createN1qlIndex`           | `QueryIndexManager\->createIndex`
|`BucketManager\->createN1qlPrimaryIndex`    | `QueryIndexManager\->createPrimaryIndex`
|`BucketManager\->dropN1qlIndex`             | `QueryIndexManager\->dropIndex`

=== New Features

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PCBC-806[PCBC-806]: Migrated core to Couchbase++.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PCBC-797[PCBC-797]: Updated the Query Index management API to use scopes and collections.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PCBC-836[PCBC-836]: Added support for the Transactions API.

=== Caveats

There are no pre-built binaries for the Windows platform of PHP SDK 4.0.0.
But there are steps in https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-php-client/blob/4.0.0/WINDOWS.md[WINDOWS.md], that describe how to build an
extension along with PHP interpreter.
The next SDK 4.0.x release will simplify this process and the pre-compiled binaries will be published.
